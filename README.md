I have been into the web3 rabbit hole for at least 6 months and until now I have not done anything away from reading & trading until this moment where I challenged myself with some design for your project. I hope you enjoy these creations. 
The idea was using some simple logos that represent the project and related work with this. With the goal to maintain the graphic content clean and aesthetic taking some inspirations of the minimalism design.
